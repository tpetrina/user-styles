# Facebook.com user style

Inspired by [Connor][1], this user style applies darker theme over default Facebook site and it removes quite a lot of (IMHO unnecessary) elements. Since I never use them, there was no point in keeping them anymore. You may disagree, hence the editing part.

## Installation
Use the Stylish extension for the browser you prefer.  
 * Get the [Chrome][2] extension.
 * Get the [Safari][3] extension.
 * Get the [Firefox][4] addon.
 
## Notes

This is still work in progress, so don't expect it to work completely just yet.
